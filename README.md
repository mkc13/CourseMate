# Course Mate

## Inspiration

In the fast-evolving world of education, students often struggle to find personalized and interactive ways to learn and assess their understanding of various subjects. Our inspiration was to create a comprehensive platform that leverages AI to facilitate self-learning, provide real-time assistance, and foster a community of learners.

## What it does

*Course Mate* is an AI-powered education platform designed to help students learn any topic at their own pace and assess their understanding effectively. It includes:

1. *Subject Helper*: Users input a subject or topic, and the platform generates a list of relevant topics and subtopics. It then creates dynamically generated quizzes based on the user’s current study focus to test their knowledge with multiple-choice questions.

2. *OCR Reader*: This feature allows students to upload documents or images containing previous year questions or other study materials. Using Google OCR API, the text is extracted and then formatted into a question paper with answers generated by OpenAI’s GPT model.

3. *Chatroom*: A discussion forum built with Socket.io and Redis, enabling users to connect, discuss doubts, and help each other with various topics in real-time.

4. *Resource Section*: A repository of community-shared public resources, including study materials, question papers, and assignments, stored in MongoDB. This section allows users to access and contribute to a pool of educational resources.

## How we built it

- *Frontend*: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The dynamic features are implemented using AJAX for API calls and DOM manipulation to update the UI.
- *Backend*: Developed using Node.js and Express. It handles API requests, manages user data, and integrates with external APIs like OpenAI and Google OCR.
- *Database*: MongoDB is used to store community-shared resources and manage user interactions.
- *Real-Time Communication*: Implemented using Socket.io and Redis for efficient real-time messaging and chatroom functionalities.

## Challenges we ran into

- *API Integration*: Ensuring smooth integration with external APIs like OpenAI and Google OCR while handling potential rate limits and errors.
- *Real-Time Features*: Implementing efficient real-time communication with Socket.io and managing user sessions with Redis.
- *Dynamic Quiz Generation*: Creating a system that dynamically generates quizzes based on user input and AI responses, ensuring relevance and accuracy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- *Innovative Features*: Successfully integrating AI-powered quiz generation and OCR capabilities into a cohesive platform.
- *Real-Time Chatroom*: Building a robust real-time chatroom that fosters collaboration and discussion among users.
- *Community Contribution*: Developing a resource-sharing section that allows users to contribute and access valuable study materials.

## What we learned

- *API Usage*: Gained experience in integrating various APIs for different functionalities and handling the complexities of external data sources.
- *Real-Time Communication*: Improved understanding of real-time web technologies and their application in collaborative platforms.
- *User Experience*: Learned the importance of designing user-friendly interfaces and ensuring seamless interactions within a web application.

## What's next for Course Mate

- *Enhanced AI Capabilities*: Further improve the AI algorithms for more accurate quiz generation and question formatting.
- *Mobile App*: Develop a mobile version of Course Mate to make the platform more accessible to users on the go.
- *Additional Features*: Incorporate features such as interactive video tutorials, personalized learning paths, and gamification to enhance the learning experience.
